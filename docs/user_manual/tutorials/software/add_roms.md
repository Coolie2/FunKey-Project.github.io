## What's Included

While hardware emulation has been upheld as legal on multiple occasions,
software piracy is entirely illegal. Therefore, rather than using pirated
games for out of the box functionality as some devices have been known for,
the FunKey S comes with [61 homebrew games][1]{target=_blank} selected for
their quality and polish from the [FunKey Wiki's homebrew game list][2]{target=_blank}.
As the 32 gigabyte MicroSD card included with the FunKey S can fit many
more games than this, however, users are free to add additional games to
their devices by simply transferring them via USB.

!!! note "Acquiring ROMs legally"

Yes, legally! Despite the widespread notion that emulation implies
piracy, the ROMs of at least [174 originally-licensed games][3]{target=_blank},
including several Sonic games via the [SEGA Mega Drive and Genesis Classics][4]{target=_blank}
collection, can be legally purchased and used on devices such as
the FunKey S.
    
## Add ROMs to the FunKey S

Once you have your games ready to go, they can be transferred from your
computer to your **FunKey S** just as you would transfer files to a USB
memory stick:
