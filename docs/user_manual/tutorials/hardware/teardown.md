Carefully remove the keychain lanyard and its axis by pulling gently (it may fall off when opening).

!!! warning
    The axis is a small part, be careful not to loose it.

### **STEP 4 - Removing the LR buttons** {.step-title}

Carefully remove the L/R plastic buttons by gently pulling them out of their axis

!!! warning
    Be careful not to damage the L/R switches on the circuit board!

### **STEP 5 - Unplugging the battery** {.step-title}

![Lift the battery](/assets/images/disassembly/IMG_8818.jpg){.step-thumb}
![Get the battery out of the way](/assets/images/disassembly/IMG_8828.jpg){.step-thumb}
![Get the battery out of the way](/assets/images/disassembly/IMG_8986_arrow.jpg){.step-thumb}

Lift the battery and pull gently by the top of the circuit board to unplug the battery. The battery may be stuck to the processor with double-sided adhesive, it's perfectly normal if you have to lift with a bit of force to unstick it. 

!!! warning
	Be sure to pull on the connector and **NOT the wires** when removing the battery. It is recommended to use tweezers.

### **STEP 6 - Unplugging the screen** {.step-title}

Now that you have access to the circuit board, you can unplug the screen. 
!!! warning
	This connector is fragile, unplug it vertically without force. It is recommended to use tweezers.

### **STEP 7 - Removing the circuit board** {.step-title}

![Pull PCB by its micro-USB port](/assets/images/disassembly/IMG_8942.jpg){.step-thumb}

![Pull PCB by its micro-USB port](/assets/images/disassembly/IMG_8902.jpg){.step-thumb}

By grabbing it **by the hinge side**, gently pull up the circuit board from the plastic casing.

### **STEP 8 - Removing the micro-SD card** {.step-title}

![Remove the micro-SD](/assets/images/disassembly/IMG_8961.jpg){.step-thumb}
![Insert the new micro-SD](/assets/images/disassembly/IMG_8957_nohand.jpg){.step-thumb}

Remove the micro-SD card from its socket.

!!! note
    You may need to use some tweezers and pull with some strength in
    order to remove the micro-SD card from its socket, as it is
    strongly inserted to prevent loose connections.
!!! warning
	During this step be very careful not to damage the L/R switches. Never put the PCB on a flat surface (this would apply force on the LR switches) and do not grab the PCB by these switches.

### **STEP 9 - Removing the buttons** {.step-title}

![Remove the micro-SD](/assets/images/disassembly/IMG_8934.jpg){.step-thumb}
![Insert the new micro-SD](/assets/images/disassembly/IMG_8905.jpg){.step-thumb}
![Insert the new micro-SD](/assets/images/disassembly/IMG_8933.jpg){.step-thumb}

Remove the buttons from their socket. It is recommended to use tweezers.

### **STEP 10 - Teardown complete** {.step-title}

![Remove the micro-SD](/assets/images/disassembly/IMG_8975.jpg){.step-thumb}
![Insert the new micro-SD](/assets/images/disassembly/IMG_8983.jpg){.step-thumb}

Good job the teardown is complete.

### **STEP 11 - Reassembly** {.step-title}

![Insert speaker first](/assets/images/disassembly/IMG_9013_YES.jpg){.step-thumb}
![Do not insert hinge first](/assets/images/disassembly/IMG_9015_NO.jpg){.step-thumb}

Insert first the speaker into its location in the casing before
putting the circuit board back in the case, like in the pictures.

Reassemble the console by following the previous steps in reverse order.

!!! warning
    Be careful not to damage the switches on the circuit board when
    putting back the L/R plastic buttons.
