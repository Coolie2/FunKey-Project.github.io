	This step is not required for changing the buttons, but we still advise it. You can however jump to the next step and not unplug the battery.

Lift the battery and pull gently by the top of the circuit board to unplug the battery. The battery may be stuck to the processor with double-sided adhesive, it's perfectly normal if you have to lift with a bit of force to unstick it.
