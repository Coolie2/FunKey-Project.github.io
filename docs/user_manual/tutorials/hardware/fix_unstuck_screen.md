Some FunKey S consoles coming from the first production batch might have an issue with the front glass not sticking correctly to the left side of the casing:

The following tutorial explains how to simply stick back the screen using standard cyanoacrylate glue. The necessary material is:

- Standard cyanoacrylate glue (US: Gorilla Super Glue, Europe: Loctite Superglue) 
- A toothpick 
- Tape

### **STEP 1 - Protecting the plastic casing with tape** {.step-title}

Stick a thin layer of tape on the plastic casing to the left side of the screen. This will avoid any glue to come in contact with it.

### **STEP 2 - Preparing the glue** {.step-title}

Appy one drop of glue on a flat impermeable surface (the back of some tape for example). One drop is enough.

### **STEP 3 - Applying the glue** {.step-title}

Dip the tip of the toothpick in the glue and apply it inside the plastic casing alongside the left edge. Multiple dips can be necessary to cover the whole side.

The toothpick tip will soften with the glue and act as a paintbrush.

!!! note
    Careful not to put too much glue in the casing.



### **STEP 4 - Sticking the glass** {.step-title}

![apply force](/assets/images/fix_unstuck_screen/DSC08652.jpg){.step-thumb}

![apply force](/assets/images/fix_unstuck_screen/DSC08655.jpg){.step-thumb}

Use your thumb to apply force on the left side of the glass for at least 2 minutes (the longer the better, this leaves more time for the glue to stick). 

You can remove the protective tape in the meantime.


### **STEP 5 - All done** {.step-title}

![apply force](/assets/images/fix_unstuck_screen/DSC08656.jpg){.step-thumb}

The glass should now hold tightly to the left side of the casing, you're ready to play!
