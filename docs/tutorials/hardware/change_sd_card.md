# I] Flashing a new SD card



# II] Switching SD cards in the FunKey S

On the FunKey S, the SD card was voluntarily placed against the casing so that it has no degree of liberty and cannot move by accident during the eventful life of a keychain. Removing/changing the SD card was nevertheless designed to be pretty straightforward and only require a standard **Phillips screwdriver (PH0)**. Please follow the steps below carefully. 


|                         **Display**                          | **Action**                                                   |

Be careful not to damage the switch on the circuit board. |

If not, then insert it first like in the pictures.<br />Reassemble the console by following the previous steps backwards |
