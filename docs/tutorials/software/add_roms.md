Connect your **FunKey S** console to your computer and add new games
as simply as you would do it with a simple USB memory stick:

| ![Eject USB](/assets/images/Eject_USB.png){: .lightbox tag=5}                           | "**EJECT USB**" is now displayed instead, now go to your host computer and open a File Explorer window                                           |
| ![USB Drive](/assets/images/USB_Drive.png){: .lightbox tag=6}                           | You should see the **FunKey S** appear as an USB drive on your computer in the File Explorer (example here with Windows 10)                      |

| ![Eject USB Are you sure](/assets/images/Eject_USB_are_you_sure.png){: .lightbox tag=9} | Back on the **FunKey S**, at the "**EJECT USB**" menu entry, press the "**A**" key twice to confirm                                              |

Of course, you can remove games from the **FunKey S** console as you
would do with a USB memory stick, too!

[^1]: The artwork file must have the same base name as the ROM file,
with a _.png_ or _.jpg_ extension, preferably with a 240 x 240
resolution.
