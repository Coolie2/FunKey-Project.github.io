Connect your **FunKey S** console to your computer and add new games
as simply as you would do it with a simple USB memory stick:

| **Display**                                                                       | **Action**                                                                                                                                       |

| ![Eject USB](/assets/images/Eject_USB.png){: .lightbox}                           | "**EJECT USB**" is now displayed instead, now go to your host computer and open a File Explorer window                                           |
| ![USB Drive](/assets/images/USB_Drive.png){: .lightbox}                           | You should see the **FunKey S** appear as an USB drive on your computer in the File Explorer (example here with Windows 10)                      |
| ![Copy ROM](/assets/images/Copy_ROM.png){: .lightbox}                             | Drag & drop the ROM file and optional artwork file[^1]  into the folder corresponding to the emulated console in this USB drive on your computer |

| ![Unmount USB](/assets/images/Mount_USB.png){: .lightbox}                         | Press the **MENU** key to return to the launcher screen                                                                                          |

Of course, you can remove games from the **FunKey S** console as you
would do with a USB memory stick, too!

[^1]: The artwork file must have the same base name as the ROM file,
with a _.png_ or _.jpg_ extension, preferably with a 240 x 240
resolution.
