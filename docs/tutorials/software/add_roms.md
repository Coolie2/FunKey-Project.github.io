# How to get ROMs legally

Yes legally! Despite the general opinion it is perfectly possible to purchase and play famous ROMs legally such as Sonic, Castlevania, Megaman and more, read the note below for more details. **The FunKey Wiki** maintains <a href="https://wiki.funkey-project.com/wiki/Available_third-party_software" target="_blank">lists</a> of legal sources for ROMs, including <a href="https://wiki.funkey-project.com/wiki/List_of_emulatable_games_(freeware)" target="_blank">freeware ROMs</a>, <a href="https://wiki.funkey-project.com/wiki/List_of_emulatable_games_(commercial)" target="_blank">commercial ROMs</a>, and <a href="https://wiki.funkey-project.com/wiki/List_of_utilities" target="_blank">utilities</a>.



**Note about ROM emulation:** While ROM emulation is often seen as illegal, and sometimes by extension emulation itself, it is simply not true. Emulating hardware is perfectly legal, no gray area about this. Sharing a software copy though is illegal, so websites that host copied ROMs or bios are illegal as well as downloading ROMs or bios from them. However, if some giant videogame companies have decided not to share their games as ROMs, it is not the case for all of them. Many companies, even giants such as SEGA, ATARI or Konami sell their retro-games online as ROMs. For example it is perfectly legal to purchase the SEGA Mega Drive and Genesis Classics on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/34270/SEGA_Mega_Drive_and_Genesis_Classics/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and play Sonic on your FunKey S. 

# Add ROMs to the FunKey S

Connect your **FunKey S** console to your computer and add new games
as simply as you would do it with a simple USB memory stick:

|                         **Display**                          | **Action**                                                   |
| :----------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![PC Connection](/assets/images/Connection_PC.png){: .lightbox} | Connect the **FunKey S** to your computer using the provided micro USB cable, then open it to turn it on |
|     ![RetroFE](/assets/images/RetroFE.png){: .lightbox}      | At the launcher's main screen (example here with RetroFE), press the **MENU** key |
|   ![Mount USB](/assets/images/Mount_USB.png){: .lightbox}    | Press the **UP**/**DOWN** keys until you see "**MOUNT USB**" |
| ![Mount USB Are you sure](/assets/images/Mount_USB_are_you_sure.png){: .lightbox} | Press the **A** key twice to confirm                         |
|   ![Eject USB](/assets/images/Eject_USB.png){: .lightbox}    | "**EJECT USB**" is now displayed instead, now go to your host computer and open a File Explorer window |
|   ![USB Drive](/assets/images/USB_Drive.png){: .lightbox}    | You should see the **FunKey S** appear as an USB drive on your computer in the File Explorer (example here with Windows 10) |
|    ![Copy ROM](/assets/images/Copy_ROM.png){: .lightbox}     | Drag & drop the ROM file and optional artwork file  into the folder corresponding to the emulated console in this USB drive on your computer<br /><br />The artwork file must have the **same base name** as the ROM file with a _.png_ or _.jpg_ extension. It is recommended to resize the artwork to a maximum dimension of 240px (big files will make scrolling less fluid on the launcher)<br />An extensive **list of artwork files** (already resized to 240x240) has been made by Coolie Coolster <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UY4J8b6eMtG_IEtvHLOqGLm-DSgMkokA" target="_blank">here</a>. <br />An otherwise complete list of artwork can be found <a href="https://github.com/libretro-thumbnails/libretro-thumbnails" target="_blank">here</a>. |
| ![Eject Drive](/assets/images/Eject_Drive.png){: .lightbox}  | Eject cleanly the USB drive from your computer               |
| ![Eject USB Are you sure](/assets/images/Eject_USB_are_you_sure.png){: .lightbox} | Back on the **FunKey S**, at the "**EJECT USB**" menu entry, press the "**A**" key twice to confirm |
|  ![Unmount USB](/assets/images/Mount_USB.png){: .lightbox}   | Press the **MENU** key to return to the launcher screen      |

Of course, you can remove games from the **FunKey S** console as you
would do with a USB memory stick, too!
