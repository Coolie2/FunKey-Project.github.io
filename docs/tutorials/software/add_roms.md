Connect your **FunKey S** console to your computer and add new games
as simply as you would do it with a simple USB memory stick:

|                         **Display**                          | **Action**                                                   |
| :----------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![PC Connection](/assets/images/Connection_PC.png){: .lightbox} | Connect the **FunKey S** to your computer using the provided micro USB cable, then open it to turn it on |
|     ![RetroFE](/assets/images/RetroFE.png){: .lightbox}      | At the launcher's main screen (example here with RetroFE), press the **MENU** key |
|   ![Mount USB](/assets/images/Mount_USB.png){: .lightbox}    | Press the **UP**/**DOWN** keys until you see "**MOUNT USB**" |
| ![Mount USB Are you sure](/assets/images/Mount_USB_are_you_sure.png){: .lightbox} | Press the **A** key twice to confirm                         |
|   ![Eject USB](/assets/images/Eject_USB.png){: .lightbox}    | "**EJECT USB**" is now displayed instead, now go to your host computer and open a File Explorer window |
|   ![USB Drive](/assets/images/USB_Drive.png){: .lightbox}    | You should see the **FunKey S** appear as an USB drive on your computer in the File Explorer (example here with Windows 10) |
|    ![Copy ROM](/assets/images/Copy_ROM.png){: .lightbox}     | Drag & drop the ROM file and optional artwork file  into the folder corresponding to the emulated console in this USB drive on your computer<br /><br />The artwork file must have the **same base name** as the ROM file with a _.png_ or _.jpg_ extension. It is recommended to resize the artwork to a maximum dimension of 240px (big files will make scrolling less fluid on the launcher)<br />An extensive **list of artwork files** (already resized to 240x240) has been made by Coolie Coolster <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UY4J8b6eMtG_IEtvHLOqGLm-DSgMkokA" target="_blank">here</a>. <br />An otherwise complete list of artwork can be found <a href="https://github.com/libretro-thumbnails/libretro-thumbnails" target="_blank">here</a>. |
| ![Eject Drive](/assets/images/Eject_Drive.png){: .lightbox}  | Eject cleanly the USB drive from your computer               |
| ![Eject USB Are you sure](/assets/images/Eject_USB_are_you_sure.png){: .lightbox} | Back on the **FunKey S**, at the "**EJECT USB**" menu entry, press the "**A**" key twice to confirm |
|  ![Unmount USB](/assets/images/Mount_USB.png){: .lightbox}   | Press the **MENU** key to return to the launcher screen      |

Of course, you can remove games from the **FunKey S** console as you
would do with a USB memory stick, too!
