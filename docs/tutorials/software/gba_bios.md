Most retro-gaming console software emulators are able to run game ROMs
directly.

However, the Game Boy Advance an PS1 emulators do require an
additional BIOS file in order to emulate all or some of the game ROMs.

## GBA

If you launch a GBA game in the first place, you will get this screen:

![GBA BIOS](/assets/images/GBA_BIOS.png)

This means that you will need to install on the **FunKey S** a BIOS
file with the right name, size and MD5 checksum before you can
actually play.

### How to find the BIOS file?

In order to find the right GBA BIOS file simply search google for
"**gba_bios.bin a860e8c0b6d573d191e4ec7d**" and download the file from
one of the proposed links.
