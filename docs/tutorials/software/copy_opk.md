**OPK** (Open PacKage) files are archive files that contains
emulators, standalone games, applications or utilities along with all
their associated resources like icons packed into a single file that
does not require installation to be able to run them.

!!! Note

    In the current (2.0.0) release of the FunKey-OS, the **OPK** files are only available for the gmenu2x launcher, and not in RetroFE.

[7-Zip][1] can be used to extract **OPK** files, and [Open Package
Creator (v1.1.2)][2] is a useful tool if you want to re-package an
**OPK** or customize icons, add additional games and much more.

Connect your **FunKey S** console to your computer and add **OPK**
files as simply as you would do it with a simple USB memory stick:

| **Display**                                                                                     | **Action**                                                                                                                                                  |

Of course, you can remove **OPK** files from the **FunKey S** console
as you would do with a USB memory stick, too!
