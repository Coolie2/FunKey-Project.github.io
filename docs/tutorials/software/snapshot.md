The **FunKey S** allows to take in-game snapshots using a simple
shortcut: just press the **Fn** + **UP** keys simultaneously.

The snapshot files will be located in the _FunKey/snapshots_ folder on
the host computer and they will be numbered following a
"**IMG_nnnn.PNG**" pattern, with "_nnnn_" being a number starting at
0001 and up to 9999.
