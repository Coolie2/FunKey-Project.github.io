## Block Diagram

Eventually, the design constraints listed in the previous section led
to the following electronic diagram, featuring 3 main blocks:

 - 1x main PCB (0.8 mm thickness) with components on both sides, the
   maximum component height above PCB on both sides is 1.5 mm. Current
   revision for this board is Revision E

 - 1x 1.54‚Äù IPS TFT LCD screen with SPI interface and using a
   custom flex cable, containing a built-in screen controller chip

 - 1x 420 mAh 402540 LiPo battery, containing an active protection
   circuitry

## BOM

An interactive BOM is available in the [next section][1].

## Schematics and Layout

All the hardware design and production files required to build the
[**FunKey S** retro-gaming console][2] electronic PCBA using the
[KiCAD ECAD tools][3] are available as Open Hardware in the [FunKey S
Hardware repository][4].

???+ note "Topological vs. logical schematic symbols"

    The **FunKey S** schematics use symbols and placement that are as
    close as possible to their corresponding physical package and
    layout, instead of defining symbols that are conveniently arranged
    by logical properties. Even if this makes schematics more complex
    at first sight, the benefit of this approach is that the step to
    go from the schematics to the physical layout becomes much easier,
    and so is the debugging of the physical board, which is then very
    close to the schematics too.

???+ note "Explicit schematic wires"

    Another habit that is used everywhere in the **FunKey S**
    schematics is that all signals (except power supplies and GND) are
    routed using explicit wires, rather than counting on invisible
    connection by net names and relying of the reader to search these
    names all over the place. This forces related components to be
    clustered in compact groups to shorten the wires, and put more
    focus on inter-cluster signals, with a natural inclination to
    unravel wire nests in the schematics before laying out the actual
    board.

???+ note "Power supply nets"

    There are some "PWR_FLAG" symbols added here and there, which is
    the proper way in KiCAD to declare that a given net has a known
    supply and thus prevent the ERC (Electrical Rule Check) to throw
    an error.

The schematics will be discussed function by function in the following
sections.
